\title{Rank-Aware Losses and Entropy-Aware Optimization for Improved Top-1 Accuracy}

\author{TODO: Author Names\\Affiliation\\\texttt{email@domain}}

\begin{document}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We explore loss functions and optimizer modifications that explicitly encourage top-1 accuracy in transformer language models. Rank-distance and flatness-boost losses weight tokens by rank and prediction entropy, while an entropy-aware AdamW dynamically increases the learning rate on flat distributions. TODO: finalize quantitative gains and wording.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Cross-entropy remains the de facto training objective for autoregressive language models, yet it does not directly optimize top-1 accuracy. Building on work such as focal loss~\cite{lin2017focal} and label smoothing~\cite{szegedy2016rethinking}, we investigate losses and optimizers that focus training on confidently predicting the correct next token. TODO: expand motivation and related work.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{Rank-distance loss}
This variant scales the per-token loss by how far the target logit ranks from the model's top prediction. TODO: include full formulation and scheduling strategy.

\subsection{Flatness-boost loss}
To discourage overly flat distributions, we amplify the loss when the maximum probability is low, akin to confidence penalties~\cite{pereyra2017regularizing}. TODO: add ablation details.

\subsection{Loss scheduling}
Our framework allows switching between loss variants during training. TODO: describe scheduling policies and implementation.

\subsection{Entropy-aware AdamW}
We propose an optimizer that boosts the learning rate when output entropy rises, drawing inspiration from entropy-aware methods~\cite{chaudhari2019entropy}. TODO: provide algorithmic pseudocode.

\section{Experiments}
We train 6-layer GPT models on the Minipile dataset using rotary embeddings and no absolute positional embeddings. Validation metrics include top-1 probability, correctness of the top prediction, and the rank of the target token. A preliminary summary appears in Table~\ref{tab:results}.

TODO: detail training hyperparameters, compute costs, and additional baselines.

\section{Discussion}
Preliminary results suggest that rank-aware and entropy-aware techniques can modestly improve top-1 accuracy over vanilla cross-entropy. TODO: analyze failure cases and interactions between components.

\section{Conclusion}
We presented a suite of modifications targeting top-1 accuracy, spanning loss design and optimizer behavior. TODO: finalize conclusions with full experimental evidence.
