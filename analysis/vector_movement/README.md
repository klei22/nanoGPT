# Vector Movement

This tool simulates the training of a 3â€‘D vector so that it aligns with a target vector.
The vectors are initialized from Gaussian distributions by default but may also be
fixed to one of the coordinate axes or the positive cube corner.

A small training loop in PyTorch is run and the movement of the vector is visualised
with Plotly as an interactive HTML animation.
