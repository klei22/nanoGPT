This directory is intended to store heatmaps produced by `vector_distribution_analysis.py`.

Example output files might include `int3_heatmap.png` or `int3_heatmap_3d.html`.
Sample images are not tracked in the repository but can be generated by running the script. The default projection uses an equal-area grid so each bin covers the same portion of the sphere.
