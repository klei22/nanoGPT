This directory is intended to store heatmaps produced by `vector_distribution_analysis.py`.

Example output files might include `int3_heatmap.png` or `int3_heatmap_3d.html`.
Sample images for the `int3` format are included to illustrate typical output.
The default projection uses an equal-area grid so each bin covers the same portion of the sphere.
