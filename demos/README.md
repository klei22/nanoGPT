# Demos

This folder will hold repeatable demonstrations of features and results.

## Shifted GELU

This shows that the GELU wants to shift:


Call this from either repo root dir, or from demos dir, but ensure the relative
path for ckpt_path is from your present directory.

Example for calling from repo root directory:

```bash
python3 demos/check_ckpt_for_gelu_shift.py \
        --ckpt_path out/ckpt.pt
```

## Grokking with Muon

The `grokking_muon_demo.sh` script compares AdamW and Muon on a modular addition
dataset and illustrates the grokking effect.
Run it from the repository root:

```bash
bash demos/grokking_muon_demo.sh
```

## Optimizer Comparison

`adam_vs_adamw.sh` trains two tiny Shakespeare models, one with Adam and one
with AdamW, then compares their statistics using `view_model_stats.py`.
